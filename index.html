            <h3>About INPTs:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>INTPs love patterns, and spotting discrepancies between statements could almost be described as a hobby, making it a bad idea to lie to a Logician.</li>
                <li>They may appear to drift about in an unending daydream, but Logicians’ thought process is unceasing, and their minds buzz with ideas from the moment they wake up.</li>
                <li>When INTPs are particularly excited, the conversation can border on incoherence as they try to explain the daisy-chain of logical conclusions that led to the formation of their latest idea.</li>
                <li>INTPs are unlikely to understand emotional complaints at all, and their friends won’t find a bedrock of emotional support in them.</li>
                <li>INTP personalities are so prone to reassessing their own thoughts and theories, worrying that they’ve missed some critical piece of the puzzle, that they can stagnate, lost in an intangible world where their thoughts are never truly applied.</li>
